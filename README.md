# BMI Calculator - Fitness & Yoga App

Our team is developing an integrated **BMI Calculator** for the **Fitness & Yoga App** to help users track their weight status and receive personalized health insights. This feature aligns with the app’s mission to provide **holistic wellness solutions**, including **workouts, yoga, nutrition, and progress tracking**.

## BMI Categories & Health Guidance
The calculator classifies users into standard BMI ranges and offers tailored recommendations:

### Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
- **Focus:** Strength training, balanced nutrition.
- **Tip:** Include calorie-dense foods like nuts and lean proteins.

### Normal Weight (BMI 18.5 – 24.9)
- **Focus:** Maintenance & overall fitness.
- **Tip:** Mix yoga, cardio, and flexibility exercises.

### Overweight (BMI 25 – 29.9)
- **Focus:** Fat loss & heart health.
- **Tip:** Prioritize portion control and brisk walking/yoga.

### Obese (BMI 30 – 34.9)
- **Focus:** Sustainable weight management.
- **Tip:** Do low-impact workouts (swimming, cycling) + mindful eating.

### Extremely Obese (BMI ≥ 35)
- **Focus:** Medical guidance + gentle activity.
- **Tip:** Consult a doctor; start with chair yoga or short walks.
